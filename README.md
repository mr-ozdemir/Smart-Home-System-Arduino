# Smart Home System with Arduino



Welcome to the "Smart Home System with Arduino" project! This project aims to turn your home into a smart environment where you can enhance security, control lights and doors remotely, and receive alerts for specific events.

## Project Overview

The Smart Home System with Arduino includes various features to make your home smarter and more convenient. Some of the key functionalities are:

- **Security:** Use motion sensors (HC-SR501) to enhance home security by detecting movement and raising alerts.
- **Remote Control:** Control apartment doors and lights remotely using the NODEMCU and ESP8266.
- **Temperature Monitoring:** Measure room temperature using the LM35 Temperature Sensor for better climate control.
- **Gas Detection:** Detect dangerous gases using the MQ-2 Gas Sensor and receive alerts.
- **Humidity Sensing:** Monitor humidity levels in your home using a humidity sensor.
- **Fire Detection:** Receive alerts in case of a fire in the house.
- **Plant Care:** Get notified when your plants need watering.
